## Project Setup

* This project utilizes [Cap'n Proto](https://capnproto.org/install.html) as a memory-mapping protocol.  As such, building the project
requires it to be installed and linked through the environment PATH variable.
    * We are currently using v0.6.1.
	* This is included via Git submodule under the /capnproto folder.
